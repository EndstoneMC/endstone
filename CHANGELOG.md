  by using `isinstance(event, Cancellable)`.
- `Dimension::getBlockAt` now returns a pointer to a `Block` directly instead of a `Result` wrapper, making the
  interface more concise. If the requested block is in an unloaded or unpopulated chunk, it returns an empty block.

## [0.5.4.1](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone/releases/tag/v0.5.4.1) - 2023-09-19
