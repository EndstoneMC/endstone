## Public Functions Documentation




### function getActor 

_Get the actor that caused the damage to occur._ 
```C++
virtual Actor * endstone::DamageSource::getActor () const = 0
```



Not to be confused with [**DamageSource::getDamagingActor()**](classendstone_1_1DamageSource.md#function-getdamagingactor), the returned actor is the actor to which the damage is ultimately attributed if the receiver is killed. If, for example, the receiver was damaged by a projectile, the shooter/thrower would be returned.




**Returns:**

an [**Actor**](classendstone_1_1Actor.md) or null

### function getDamagingActor 

_Get the actor that directly caused the damage._ 
```C++
virtual Actor * endstone::DamageSource::getDamagingActor () const = 0
```



Not to be confused with [**DamageSource::getActor()**](classendstone_1_1DamageSource.md#function-getactor), the returned actor is the actor that actually inflicted the damage. If, for example, the receiver was damaged by a projectile, the projectile would be returned.




**Returns:**

an [**Actor**](classendstone_1_1Actor.md) or null 





        

<hr>



### function getType 

_Get the damage type._ 
```C++
virtual std::string_view endstone::DamageSource::getType () const = 0
```





**Returns:**

the damage type 





        

<hr>



### function isIndirect 

_Get if this damage is indirect._ 
```C++
virtual bool endstone::DamageSource::isIndirect () const = 0
```



Damage is considered indirect if [**DamageSource::getActor()**](classendstone_1_1DamageSource.md#function-getactor) is not equal to [**DamageSource::getDamagingActor()**](classendstone_1_1DamageSource.md#function-getdamagingactor). This will be the case, for example, if a skeleton shot an arrow or a player threw a potion.




**Returns:**

true if is indirect, false otherwise.

### function ~DamageSource 

```C++
virtual endstone::DamageSource::~DamageSource () = default
```
