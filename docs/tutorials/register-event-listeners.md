# Register event listeners

Endstone provides a powerful event system that allows plugins to listen to various events that happen in the
server. Let's walk you through registering a simple event listener.

## Add event handlers

Let's say your plugin want to listen to when a player joins the server and send a message to inform everyone on the
server.

    ``` python title="src/endstone_my_plugin/my_plugin.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="1-2 13-16"
    from endstone import ColorFormat
    from endstone.event import event_handler, PlayerJoinEvent
    from endstone.plugin import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):
        api_version = "{{ git.short_tag[1:].rsplit('.', 1)[0] }}"

        # ...

        def on_enable(self) -> None:
            self.logger.info("on_enable is called!")

        @event_handler
        def on_player_join(self, event: PlayerJoinEvent):
            self.server.broadcast_message(ColorFormat.YELLOW + f"{event.player.name} has joined the server")
    ```

=== ":simple-cplusplus: C++"

    ``` c++ title="include/my_plugin.h" linenums="1" hl_lines="12-15"
    #include <endstone/endstone.hpp>

    class MyPlugin : public endstone::Plugin {
    public:
        // ...

        void onEnable() override
        {
            getLogger().info("onEnable is called");
        }
    
        void onPlayerJoin(endstone::PlayerJoinEvent& event)
        {
            getServer().broadcastMessage(ColorFormat::Yellow + "{} has joined the server", event.getPlayer().getName());
        }
    };
    ```

## Register listeners

Now, we need to register our event handlers to the Endstone event system.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ``` python title="src/endstone_my_plugin/my_plugin.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="12"
    from endstone import ColorFormat
    from endstone.event import event_handler, PlayerJoinEvent
    from endstone.plugin import Plugin

    class MyPlugin(Plugin):
        api_version = "{{ git.short_tag[1:].rsplit('.', 1)[0] }}"

        # ...

        def on_enable(self) -> None:
            self.logger.info("on_enable is called!")
            self.register_events(self)

        @event_handler
        def on_player_join(self, event: PlayerJoinEvent):
            self.server.broadcast_message(ColorFormat.YELLOW + f"{event.player.name} has joined the server")
    ```

    By calling `self.register_events`, Endstone will look into the object that is passed in as the argument and
    register all handlers with a `@event_handler` decorator to the event system.

=== ":simple-cplusplus: C++"

    ``` c++ title="include/my_plugin.h" linenums="1" hl_lines="10"
    #include <endstone/endstone.hpp>

    class MyPlugin : public endstone::Plugin {
    public:
        // ...

        void onEnable() override
        {
            getLogger().info("onEnable is called");
            registerEvent(&MyPlugin::onPlayerJoin, *this);
        }
    
        void onPlayerJoin(endstone::PlayerJoinEvent& event)
        {
            getServer().broadcastMessage(ColorFormat::Yellow + "{} has joined the server", event.getPlayer().getName());
        }
    };
    ```

**:partying_face: And that's it!** Your plugin should now listen to and handle events when player joins.
Remember, you can add as many methods as you want to listen to any event.
